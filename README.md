# Serverless Functions

## Installing packages Locally vs Globally:

Installing a package globally allows you to use the code in the package as a set of tools on your local computer.
To download and install packages globally, on the command line, run the following command:<br>
`npm install -g <package_name>`

You can find where global packages are installed by running:<br>
`Nom root -g`

Finally you can list all local installed packed with command:<br>
`npm ls -g â€”depth 0`

Serverless has transformed application development by eliminating the need to provision and manage any underlying infrastructure. The current serverless ecosystem has grown more mature, and it now has considerable overlap with the world of container-based technologies. The wide range of available options has led over half of organizations operating in each cloud to adopt serverless.
